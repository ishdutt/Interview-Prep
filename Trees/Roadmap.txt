1. It will be only be encountered in Interview only.
2. Most of them are recursion based only(Atleast uptil now).
3. So most of the question will be from GFG or leetcode. So sometimes, the code will have 
   only the important function taken form those sites. Since creating tree makes the code long and 
   are not fit for testing. Add the link of that question along witj the function. Better make the 
   files as txt, in that way, there won't be any irritating marks.
4. Caution.. take a lookm at where accesing using -> and where "." is used.. for complete DSA.
